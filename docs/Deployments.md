# OpenTripPlanner Deployments Worldwide

## Official Production

The following are known deployments of OTP in a government- or agency-sponsored production capacity:

* **Finland (nationwide)** The [Helsinki Regional Transport Authority](https://www.reittiopas.fi/), the [Finnish Transport Agency](https://opas.matka.fi/), and other [Finnish cities](https://waltti.fi/?lang=en) have collaborated to create [Digitransit](https://digitransit.fi/en/), providing OTP-based trip planners, APIs, open data, Docker containers and open source code. Each member organisation runs its own instance of a shared codebase and deployment environment. Their source code is available [on Github](https://github.com/HSLdevcom/), including a [new custom UI](https://github.com/HSLdevcom/digitransit-ui). This system also has a strong real-time component.
* **Norway (nationwide)** Ruter provides a [journey planner for the Oslo region](https://ruter.no/). It has been in production since January 2016 and serves around 200,000 users per day. Since November 2017, Entur has also prodvided a [nation-wide journey planner](https://en-tur.no/) which consumes schedule data in the EU standard NeTEx format with SIRI realtime updates.
